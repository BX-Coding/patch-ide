# Patch Project Goals

Goal: Increase the throughput of the in-school computing education pipeline

## Problem Statements

What challenges are preventing students from coding in schools?

### Teaching text-based coding requires too high of technical skills from educators

**_For most teachers, CS is not their first priority_**

Suppose an educator wants--or more likely is told to--to start facilitating a Computer Science curriculum for a text-based programming language in their classroom. In that case, there are many hurdles they have to overcome even to start.

- The educator must find a way for all students to code on a technology-agnostic platform.
- The educator must educate themselves to the point of competency in text-based programming
- The educator must create or find a curriculum aligned with their state standards
- The educator must manage a classroom where students receive enough support to reduce the challenge of starting text-based programming.

It is an incredibly tall order for teachers who are likely already teaching multiple subjects.

### Text-based programming is not engaging enough for young learners

**_Text-based programming is where creativity goes to die_**

Text-based programming, as it stands right now, is not a creative medium for young novice programmers. There is an incredibly high knowledge barrier to creating interesting (non-turtle) graphical output with a text-based programming language. In Scratch, users only have to recognize the function of four blocks, drag these blocks and connect them in the correct order, and press the green flag button to see a relatively engaging graphical output. In Python, an equivalent program made with Pygames would require typing around 60 lines of code and a strong grasp of the PyGames game engine. The rigidity and vocabulary of Python, especially when creating graphical output, means that it's difficult to creatively explore in Python.

## Strategies

_**What strategies does Patch employ to address these issues?**_

### Problem 1: Teaching text-based coding requires too high of technical skills from educators

Strategies

- Low technology knowledge requirement (no installs needed)
- Low hardware requirements (can run on school Chromebooks)
- Easy-to-facilitate paired curriculum
- Professional development
- Alignment with national and state computing education standards
- Project-based learning
- Integration with an LMS
- Intuitive error messages
- Program execution feedback
- Clear performance evalutation methods

### Problem 2: Text-based programming is not engaging enough for young learners

Strategies

- Graphical output
- Creative Computing Focused
- Learner agency focused
- Camera, Mircophone, & keyboard input
- Cultivate learner self-efficacy
- Intuitive and readable code
- Opinionated autocomplete
- Less typing
- Tinkerable -- facilitates easy & intuitive trial and error
