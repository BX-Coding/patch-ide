# Patch Project Goals
Goal: Be the easiest way an educator can teach Python
## Problem Statements
What problems does Patch solve?
### Teaching text-based coding requires too high of technical skills from educators  
**_For most teachers CS is not their first priority_**  

Suppose an educator wants--or more likely is told to--to start facilitating a Computer Science curriculum for a text-based programming language in their classroom. In that case, there are many hurdles they have to overcome even to start. To list a couple, they must find a way for all students to code on a technology-agnostic platform, they must educate themselves to the point of competency in text-based programming, they must create or find a curriculum aligned with their state standards, and they must manage a classroom where students receive enough support to reduce the challenge of starting text-based programming. It is an incredibly tall order for teachers who are likely already teaching multiple subjects.

### Text-based programming is not engaging enough for young learners
**_Text-based programming is where creativity goes to die_**  

Text-based programming as it stands right now, is not a creative medium for young novice programmers. There is an incredibly high knowledge barrier to creating interesting* graphical output with a text-based programming language. For example, in Scratch to create a teleporting rainbow cat, users need only to follow a couple of steps. First, they must recognize the function of four blocks. Then, they must drag these blocks out into the programming area and connect them in the correct order. Finally, they have to press the green flag button and they get a relatively engaging graphical output. In Python, an equivalent program made with Pygames would require typing around 60 lines of code and a strong grasp of the PyGames game engine. The amount of code that this requires can be intimidating and risks taking a learner's focus away from learning the component skills of programming.

### Programming environments do not have enough scaffolding for the complex tasks that programming require
**_Text-based programming is hard!_**   

Text-based programming is a complex task made up of numerous component skills. Conceptually, some of these skills are covered in computing education frameworks such as computational thinking. However, there are other extremely important component skills not directly related to computational thinking that come with text-based programming environments. Some examples of these are typing, error message parsing, or even knowing the vocabulary of a library. All of these present significant challenges to learners that, if not properly scaffolded.

## Strategies
_**What strategies do Patch employ to address these issues?**_
### Teaching text-based coding requires too high of technical skills from educators
- Low technology knowledge requirement (no installs needed)
- Low hardware requirements (can run on school Chromebooks)
- Easy-to-facilitate paired curriculum
- Professional development
- Alignment with national and state computing education standards
- Project-based learning
- Integration with an LMS

### Text-based programming is not engaging enough for young learners
- Graphical output
- Creative Computing Focused
- Learner agency focused
- Multiple types of input
- Cultivate learner ownership over work
- Easy transition between block-based to text-based programming

### Text-based programming environments do not provide scaffolding for the complex tasks that programming require
- Decrease the amount of typing required
- Intuitive error messages
- Program execution feedback
- AI to help scaffold component skills
- Opinionated autocomplete
- Tinkerable
