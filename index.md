## The Goal

Learning the syntax of text-based programming languages can be hard, and it is often a roadblock for many young learners looking to take their first step into text-based programming languages after being introduced to Scratch. Python is often the first recommendation because of its simplistic syntax and massive popularity as a scripting language. However, leaners’ first experiences with Python after being introduced to programming with Scratch often are not positive. This is because, there is a distinct loss of agency between the two experiences. Even somewhat tenured Scratch users, can create almost anything their creative minds can conjure. On the other hand, a somewhat experienced Scratch user attempting to begin learning Python will be presented with a plethora of step-by-step more direct and structured projects. While many of the core programming concepts that Scratch naturally teaches do translate to Python almost perfectly, there is still a loss of agency from the pure amount of new syntax , vocabulary, and libraries that a young learner must become familiar with to produce something similar to what they could create in Scratch. This is where Pyatch comes into play. Pyatch presents the exact same block API that Scratch presents except in a text format and it does it all online too. Consequently, young learners interested in beginning with Python from Scratch can still utilize their knowledge of the Scratch block library in their Pyatch projects. As a result, the frustrating combination of issues of lack of library knowledge and the lack of knowledge of Python’s syntax can be avoided.
