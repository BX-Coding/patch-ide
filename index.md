## The Problem

Learning the syntax of text-based programming languages can be hard, and it is often a roadblock for many young learners looking to take their first step into text-based programming languages after being introduced to Scratch. Python is often the first recommendation because of its simplistic syntax and massive popularity as a scripting language. However, leanersâ€™ first experiences with Python after being introduced to programming with Scratch often are not positive. This is because, there is a distinct loss of agency between the two experiences. Even only somewhat skilled Scratch users, can create almost anything their creative minds can conjure. On the other hand, a somewhat experienced Scratch user attempting to begin learning Python will be presented with a slew of step-by-step extremely structured projects. While many of the core programming concepts that Scratch naturally teaches do translate to Python, there is still a significant loss of agency of the learner due to the pure amount of new syntax, vocabulary, and libraries that a young learner must become familiar with to produce something similar to what they could create in Scratch. 

## The Solution

Pyatch's intent is to utilize a teaching pattern that we have used at [BX Coding](https://bxcoding.com) camps numerous times with great success when making the tranistion between block-based programming to text-based programming. We give very explicit references between a scratch block and a function in the programming language we are transitioning to, breaking down the layout of the block and how this related to the layout of a function call. Notabley, this transition has also been seen to improve students self-efficacy in coding in case studies such a [this one](https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2022.2090467). Pyatch aims to integrate this teaching pattern into an online tool optimized for helping young computer sciencetists learn the Python syntax. Pyatch exposes the exact same API that Scratch uses for their blocks except through a Python library. Consequently, young computer scientists interested in beginning with Python that are coming from Scratch can still utilize their knowledge of the Scratch block library in their Pyatch projects. As a result,  one of the major challenges of beginning text-based programming can be overcome. 

## Conclusion

Scratch is an incredible tool and is widely used in CS education. More likely than not, it will be young computer scientists first introduction to programming. Purposefully or not, by the time a student has progressed to the point to where they are looking ot explore text-based programming they have become familiarized with an enormous amount of Scratch vocabulary presented by it's API.
